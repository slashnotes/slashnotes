Slashnotes is a note-taking app that aims to be available for your lifetime.

Whole lifetime availability means that two conditions are met.

The first is that the user has full ownership of the content of their notes, including the ability to modify the content of their notes without the restrictions of the software.

Secondly, the source code of the note-taking software itself is open and can be modified.

So Slashnotes is based on plain-text files and open source with [AGPL-2.0 License](./LICENSE).

## System Requirements
